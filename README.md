# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project
Data Scientist Project (SQL) : Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, we are asked a series of questions that will help us profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. I have made sure to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, we are asked to come up with our own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question we want to answer. We will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis we choose to do. I have made sure that I use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate my intent as required.
